# Dataset Description:

The "Air Quality" dataset, sourced from the public database (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/air-quality), contains 18,025 rows and 12 columns, providing detailed information about air quality indicators and measurements. Key columns include a unique identifier (Unique ID), indicator ID, and the name of the air quality indicator (e.g., "Fine particles (PM 2.5)" or "Boiler Emissions - Total SO2 Emissions"). Measurements are described by type (Measure) and unit (Measure Info), such as "Mean" or "Number per km²" with corresponding units like "mcg/m³." Geographic information is detailed through region types (Geo Type Name), spatial identifiers (Geo Join ID), and place names (Geo Place Name). The dataset includes temporal attributes, such as a descriptive time period (Time Period) and precise start dates (Start_Date), alongside the recorded air quality value (Data Value). The data integrates temporal, spatial, and environmental metrics, covering regions and periods like "Annual Average 2012" or "Summer 2022," and is useful for analyzing pollution trends, public health impacts, and environmental policy development.

# Our 2 Questions and Why they are Important:
1. How do the average levels of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) vary across different geographic areas over time?

This question is critical due to the significant social and health implications of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5). PM 2.5 is a key air pollutant that poses severe risks to human health, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, particularly in vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly. Understanding its variation across geographic areas allows policymakers and public health officials to target high-risk regions with interventions, such as stricter regulations or public health campaigns. Economically, reducing PM 2.5 levels can decrease healthcare costs associated with treating pollution-related illnesses and improve workforce productivity. Culturally, this question addresses environmental justice, as historically underserved communities often bear a disproportionate burden of air pollution. This question is tied directly to the dataset, which provides geographic, temporal, and measurement-specific data for PM 2.5 levels, enabling analysis of trends and disparities.

2. Is there a relationship between specific emission types (e.g., SO2 emissions) and air quality indicators like PM 2.5 levels across different geographic areas?

This question is important as it investigates the causal or correlative factors affecting air quality, particularly the role of specific emissions like sulfur dioxide (SO2). SO2 is a precursor to secondary particulate matter, such as PM 2.5, which exacerbates air quality issues. Exploring this relationship can inform policy and regulatory frameworks, guiding industries to adopt cleaner technologies or reduce emissions. This has significant economic implications, as improving air quality can reduce public health expenditures and mitigate the long-term costs of environmental degradation. Additionally, it aligns with global sustainability goals, fostering a transition to cleaner energy sources and promoting environmental stewardship. The dataset is well-suited for this analysis, as it includes detailed emissions data (e.g., SO2) and air quality measurements (e.g., PM 2.5), categorized by geographic areas and time periods, enabling the study of spatial and temporal patterns.
