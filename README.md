# Dataset Description:

The "Air Quality" dataset, sourced from the public database (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/air-quality), contains 18,025 rows and 12 columns, providing detailed information about air quality indicators and measurements. Key columns include a unique identifier (Unique ID), indicator ID, and the name of the air quality indicator (e.g., "Fine particles (PM 2.5)" or "Boiler Emissions - Total SO2 Emissions"). Measurements are described by type (Measure) and unit (Measure Info), such as "Mean" or "Number per km²" with corresponding units like "mcg/m³." Geographic information is detailed through region types (Geo Type Name), spatial identifiers (Geo Join ID), and place names (Geo Place Name). The dataset includes temporal attributes, such as a descriptive time period (Time Period) and precise start dates (Start_Date), alongside the recorded air quality value (Data Value). A column labeled "Message" is present but contains no data. The data integrates temporal, spatial, and environmental metrics, covering regions and periods like "Annual Average 2012" or "Summer 2022," and is useful for analyzing pollution trends, public health impacts, and environmental policy development.

# Our 2 Questions and Why they are Important:
Questions.
1. How do the average levels of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) vary across different geographic areas over time?
2. Is there a relationship between specific emission types (e.g., SO2 emissions) and air quality indicators like PM 2.5 levels across different geographic areas?
